# Flatpak

Note: this is a bit of an experiment, and won't be updated unless I manage to get updates automatically happening, and ensure there is a way for users to run applications in the same way they would on any platform.

To install this repository run:
> flatpak remote-add purplebooth https://purplebooth.github.io/flatter/index.flatpakrepo

To see what's available have a look in "[flatpak](./flatpak)"
